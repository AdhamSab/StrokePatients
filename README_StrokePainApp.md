# ðŸ§  Stroke Pain Detection App

A Streamlit-based app for automatically assessing pain intensity in stroke patients using facial asymmetry and deep learning.

This project uses three steps:
1. **Detect the affected side** of a stroke patient's face using a Keras-based CNN model.
2. **Crop the unaffected half** of the face.
3. Use a PyTorch model to **predict the pain intensity (PSPI score)** from the expressive half.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This App

Simply upload a **full-face image** of a stroke patient and let the model:
- Detect the affected side
- Crop the unaffected side
- Predict the patient's pain intensity (PSPI)

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

This app is part of a larger system to:
- Automatically detect which side of a stroke patient's face is impaired
- Use the **expressive side** to analyze pain using PSPI (Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity) scores
